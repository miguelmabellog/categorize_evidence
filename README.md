# categorize_evidence_MVP_androidApp

This code is from an android application, with this application you can sort evidence pictures and videos out, based on main categorices that Colombian lawyers use to report humman rights violations at strikes. This app was developed in android studio with Java lengauge, MVP architecture and FireStore conexion.

## Gettin started

This app is connected with Firebase thus you must create a new database and change this conexion, busides you should create a new user and password to be able sign in the firebase auth, as you can see in the image there's not option to create new user from the app so you should create it from firebase console.
